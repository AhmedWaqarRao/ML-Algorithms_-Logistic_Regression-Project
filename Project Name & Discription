1. Analyzing Advertising Dataset to Predict Ad Click using Logistic RegressionAnalyzing Advertising Dataset to Predict Ad Click using Logistic Regression

Using the advertising.csv dataset we try to predict whether a user based on different input parameters
such as age, daily time spent on site, daily internet usage, etc clicked on an ad or not.
We use Logistic Regression to provide input parameters and try to predict the output label that is clicked on the ad. 
We also cleaned the data and converted some continuous data to categorical data to extract maximum information from the data.


2. Titanic Dataset to Predict Surviving PassengersTitanic Dataset to Predict Surviving Passengers

Using the titanic_train.csv dataset tried to predict whether the passenger survived or not using Logistic Regression. 
Some of the columns were missing values, 
so we cleaned the data first either by deleting the row altogether 
or by extrapolating the values of the non-null entries to null entries 
if the column was not missing a lot of the values. We then train by 
logistic regression which is a binary classifier and predicts either 
Survived or not survived,
based on other input features from the titanic_train.csv dataset. 
Then we test our trained model on the titanic_test.csv dataset.
